 * Lookaside stack with two sides, low and high, to push to or pop from, sharing 
 * the stack's capacity.
 *
 * Lookaside means that it's the users job to provide and work on the collection 
 * of elements of the full stack while the lookaside structure is more of a 
 * header for bookkeeping.
 *
 * Minimizing return codes based on the article 
 * "Managing Decoupling Part 4 â€” The ID Lookup Table" by of Niklas Frykholm and
 * the accompanying discussions:
 * http://altdevblogaday.com/2011/09/23/managing-decoupling-part-4-the-id-lookup-table/
 * http://bitsquid.blogspot.com/2011/09/managing-decoupling-part-4-id-lookup.html
 *
 * It is written under the assumption that you should know that a call is
 * valid before calling. Know because you know the data or because you call an
 * empty or full check before (possibly in an assertion).
 * In debug builds triggering undefined behavior triggers assertions.
